# Features

- MQTT 3.1.1 compliant library
- Sending and receiving at all QoS levels
- TCP and TCP/TLS using standard WiFiClient and WiFiClientSecure connections
- Virtually unlimited incoming and outgoing payload sizes
- Readable and understandable code
- Fully async clients available via [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) or [ESPAsnycTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) (no TLS supported)
- Supported platforms:
  - Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32 using the Arduino framework
- Basic Linux compatibility*. This includes WSL on Windows

    > Linux compatibility is mainly for automatic testing. It relies on a quick and dirty Arduino-style `Client` with a POSIX TCP client underneath and Arduino-style `IPAddress` class. These are lacking many features needed for proper Linux support.

# Runtime behaviour

A normal operation cycle of an MQTT client goes like this:

1. setup the client
2. connect to the broker
3. subscribe/publish/receive
4. disconnect/reconnect when disconnected
5. Cleanly disconnect

### Setup

Setting up the client means to tell which host and port to connect to, possible credentials to use and so on. espMqttClient has a set of methods to configure the client. Setup is generally done in the `setup()` function of the Arduino framework.
One important thing to remember is that there are a number of settings that are not stored inside the library: `username`, `password`, `willTopic`, `willPayload`, `clientId` and `host`. Make sure these variables stay available during the lifetime of the `espMqttClient`.

For TLS secured connections, the relevant methods from `WiFiClientSecure` have been made available to setup the TLS mechanisms.

### Connecting

After setting up the client, you are ready to connect. A simple call to `connect()` does the job. If you set an `OnConnectCallback`, you will be notified when the connection has been made. On failure, `OnDisconnectCallback` will be called. Although good code structure can avoid this, you can call `connect()` multiple times.

### Subscribing, publishing and receiving

Once connected, you can subscribe, publish and receive. The methods to do this return the packetId of the generated packet or `1` for packets without packetId. In case of an error, the method returns `0`. When the client is not connected, you cannot subscribe, unsubscribe or publish (configurable, see [EMC_ALLOW_NOT_CONNECTED_PUBLISH](#EMC_ALLOW_NOT_CONNECTED_PUBLISH)).

Receiving packets is done via the `onMessage`-callback. This callback gives you the topic, properties (qos, dup, retain, packetId) and payload. For the payload, you get a pointer to the data, the index, length and total length. On long payloads it is normal that you get multiple callbacks for the same packet. This way, you can receive payloads longer than what could fit in the microcontroller's memory.

    > Beware that MQTT payloads are binary. MQTT payloads are **not** c-strings unless explicitely constructed like that. You therefore can **not** print the payload to your Serial monitor without supporting code.

### Disconnecting

You can disconnect from the broker by calling `disconnect()`. If you do not force-disconnect, the client will first send the remaining messages that are in the queue and disconnect afterwards. During this period however, no new incoming PUBLISH messages will be processed.

# API Reference

```cpp
espMqttClient()
espMqttClientSecure()
espMqttClientAsync()
```

Instantiate a new espMqttClient or espMqttSecure object.
On ESP32, two optional parameters are available: `espMqttClient(uint8_t priority = 1, uint8_t core = 1)`. This will change the priority of the MQTT client task and the core on which it runs (higher priority = more cpu-time).

For the asynchronous version, use `espMqttClientAsync`.

### Configuration

```cpp
espMqttClient& setKeepAlive(uint16_t keepAlive)
```

Set the keep alive. Defaults to 15 seconds.

* **`keepAlive`**: Keep alive in seconds

```cpp
espMqttClient& setClientId(const char* clientId)
```

Set the client ID. Defaults to `esp8266123456` or `esp32123456` where `123456` is the chip ID.
The library only stores a pointer to the client ID. Make sure the variable pointed to stays available throughout the lifetime of espMqttClient.

- **`clientId`**: Client ID, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)

```cpp
espMqttClient& setCleanSession(bool cleanSession)
```

Set the CleanSession flag. Defaults to `true`.

- **`cleanSession`**: clean session wanted or not

```cpp
espMqttClient& setCredentials(const char* username, const char* password)
```

Set the username/password. Defaults to non-auth.
The library only stores a pointer to the username and password. Make sure the variable to pointed stays available throughout the lifetime of espMqttClient.

- **`username`**: Username, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`password`**: Password, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)

```cpp
espMqttClient& setWill(const char* topic, uint8_t qos, bool retain, const uint8_t* payload, size_t length)
```

Set the Last Will. Defaults to none.
The library only stores a pointer to the topic and payload. Make sure the variable pointed to stays available throughout the lifetime of espMqttClient.

- **`topic`**: Topic of the LWT, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS of the LWT
- **`retain`**: Retain flag of the LWT
- **`payload`**: Payload of the LWT.
- **`length`**: Payload length

```cpp
espMqttClient& setWill(const char* topic, uint8_t qos, bool retain, const char* payload)
```

Set the Last Will. Defaults to none.
The library only stores a pointer to the topic and payload. Make sure the variable pointed to stays available throughout the lifetime of espMqttClient.

- **`topic`**: Topic of the LWT, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS of the LWT
- **`retain`**: Retain flag of the LWT
- **`payload`**: Payload of the LWT, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string). Its lenght will be calculated using `strlen(payload)`

```cpp
espMqttClient& setServer(IPAddress ip, uint16_t port)
```

Set the server. Mind that when using `espMqttClientSecure` with a certificate, the hostname will be chacked against the certificate. Often IP-addresses are not valid and the connection will fail.

- **`ip`**: IP of the server
- **`port`**: Port of the server

```cpp
espMqttClient& setServer(const char* host, uint16_t port)
```

Set the server.

- **`host`**: Host of the server, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`port`**: Port of the server

#### Options for TLS connections

All common options from WiFiClientSecure to setup an encrypted connection are made available. These include:

- `espMqttClientSecure& setInsecure()`
- `espMqttClientSecure& setCACert(const char* rootCA)` (ESP32 only)
- `espMqttClientSecure& setCertificate(const char* clientCa)` (ESP32 only)

### Operational functions

```cpp
bool connected()
```

Returns if the client is currently fully connected to the broker or not. During connecting or disconnecting, it will return false.

```cpp
bool disconnected()
```

Returns if the client is currently disconnected to the broker or not. During disconnecting or connecting, it will return false.

```cpp
void connect()
```

Connect to the server.

```cpp
void disconnect(bool force = false)
```

Disconnect from the server.
When disconnecting with `force` false, the client first tries to handle all the outgoing messages in the queue and disconnect cleanly afterwards. During this time, no incoming PUBLISH messages are handled.

- **`force`**: Whether to force the disconnection. Defaults to `false` (clean disconnection).

```cpp
uint16_t subscribe(const char* topic, uint8_t qos)
```

Subscribe to the given topic at the given QoS. Return the packet ID or 0 if failed.

- **`topic`**: Topic, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS

It is also possible to subscribe to multiple topics at once. Just add the topic/qos pairs to the parameters:

```cpp
uint16_t packetId = yourclient.subscribe(topic1, qos1, topic2, qos2, topic3, qos3);  // add as many topics as you like*
```

```cpp
uint16_t unsubscribe(const char* topic)
```

Unsubscribe from the given topic. Return the packet ID or 0 if failed.

- **`topic`**: Topic, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)

It is also possible to unsubscribe to multiple topics at once. Just add the topics to the parameters:

```cpp
uint16_t packetId = yourclient.unsubscribe(topic1, topic2, topic3);  // add as many topics as you like*
```

```cpp
uint16_t publish(const char* topic, uint8_t qos, bool retain, const uint8* payload, size_t length)
```

Publish a packet. Return the packet ID (or 1 if QoS 0) or 0 if failed. The topic and payload will be buffered by the library.

- **`topic`**: Topic, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS
- **`retain`**: Retain flag
- **`payload`**: Payload
- **`length`**: Payload length

```cpp
uint16_t publish(const char* topic, uint8_t qos, bool retain, const char* payload)
```

Publish a packet. Return the packet ID (or 1 if QoS 0) or 0 if failed. The topic and payload will be buffered by the library.

- **`topic`**: Topic, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS
- **`retain`**: Retain flag
- **`payload`**: Payload, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string). Its lenght will be calculated using `strlen(payload)`

```cpp
uint16_t publish(const char* topic, uint8_t qos, bool retain, espMqttClientTypes::PayloadCallback callback, size_t length)
```

Publish a packet with a callback for payload handling. Return the packet ID (or 1 if QoS 0) or 0 if failed. The topic will be buffered by the library.

- **`topic`**: Topic, expects a null-terminated char array (c-string)
- **`qos`**: QoS
- **`retain`**: Retain flag
- **`callback`**: callback to fetch the payload.

The callback has the following signature: `size_t callback(uint8_t* data, size_t maxSize, size_t index)`. When the library needs payload data, the callback will be invoked. It is the callback's job to write data indo `data` with a maximum of `maxSize` bytes, according the `index` and return the amount of bytes written.

```cpp
void clearQueue()
```

When disconnected, clears all queued messages.
Keep in mind that this also deletes any session data and therefore is no MQTT compliant.

```cpp
void loop()
```

This is the worker function of the MQTT client. For ESP8266 you must call this function in the Arduino loop. For ESP32 this function is only used internally and is not available in the API.

```cpp
const char* getClientId() const
```

Retuns the client ID.

# Compile time configuration

A number of constants which influence the behaviour of the client can be set at compile time. You can set these options in the `Config.h` file or pass the values as compiler flags. Because these options are compile-time constants, they are used for all instances of `espMqttClient` you create in your program.

### EMC_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 1440

The client copies incoming data into a buffer before parsing. This sets the buffer size.

### EMC_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 1440

When publishing using the callback, the client fetches data in chunks of EMC_TX_BUFFER_SIZE size. This is not necessarily the same as the actual outging TCP packets.

### EMC_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH 128

For **incoming** messages, a maximum topic length is set. Topics longer than this will be truncated.

### EMC_PAYLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE 32

Set the incoming payload buffer size for SUBACK messages. When subscribing to multiple topics at once, the acknowledgement contains all the return codes in its payload. The detault of 32 means you can theoretically subscribe to 32 topics at once.

### EMC_MIN_FREE_MEMORY 4096

The client keeps all outgoing packets in a queue which stores its data in heap memory. With this option, you can set the minimum available (contiguous) heap memory that needs to be available for adding a message to the queue.

### EMC_ESP8266_MULTITHREADING 0

Set this to 1 if you use the async version on ESP8266. For the regular client this setting can be kept disabled because the ESP8266 doesn't use multithreading and is only single-core.

### EMC_ALLOW_NOT_CONNECTED_PUBLISH 1

By default, you can publish when the client is not connected. If you don't want this, set this to 0.

### EMC_CLIENTID_LENGTH 18 + 1

The (maximum) length of the client ID. (Keep in mind that this is a c-string. You need to have 1 position available for the null-termination.)

### EMC_TASK_STACK_SIZE 5000

Only used on ESP32. Sets the stack size (in words) of the MQTT client worker task.

### EMC_USE_WATCHDOG 0

(ESP32 only)

**Experimental**

You can enable a watchdog on the MQTT task. This is experimental and will probably result in resets because some (framework) function calls block without feeding the dog.

### Logging

If needed, you have to enable logging at compile time. This is done differently on ESP32 and ESP8266.

ESP8266:

- Enable logging for Arduino [see docs](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Troubleshooting/debugging.html)
- Pass the `DEBUG_ESP_MQTT_CLIENT` flag to the compiler

ESP32

- Enable logging for Arduino [see docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/guides/tools_menu.html?#core-debug-level)

# Code samples

A number of examples are in the [examples](/examples) directory. These include basic operation on ESP8266 and ESP32. Please examine these to understand the basic operation of the MQTT client.

Below are examples on specific points for working with this library.

### Printing payloads

MQTT 3.1.1 defines no special format for the payload so it is treated as binary. If you want to print a payload to the Arduino serial console, you have to make sure that the payload is null-terminated (c-string).

```cpp
// option one: print the payload char by char
void onMqttMessage(const espMqttClientTypes::MessageProperties& properties, const char* topic, const uint8_t* payload, size_t len, size_t index, size_t total) {
  Serial.println("Publish received:");
  Serial.printf("  topic: %s\n  payload:", topic);
  const char* p = reinterpret_cast<const char*>(payload);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
    Serial.print(p[i]);
  }
  Serial.print("\n");
}
```

```cpp
// option two: copy the payload into a c-string
// you cannot just do payload[len] = 0 because you do not own this memory location! 
void onMqttMessage(const espMqttClientTypes::MessageProperties& properties, const char* topic, const uint8_t* payload, size_t len, size_t index, size_t total) {
  Serial.println("Publish received:");
  Serial.printf("  topic: %s\n  payload:", topic);
  char* strval = new char[len + 1];
  memcpy(strval, payload, len);
  strval[len] = "\0";
  Serial.println(strval);
  delete[] strval;
}
```

### Assembling chunked messages

The `onMessage`-callback is called as data comes in. So if the data comes in partially, the callback will be called on every receipt of a chunk, with the proper `index`, (chunk)`size` and `total` set. With little code, you can reassemble chunked messages yourself.

```cpp
const size_t maxPayloadSize = 8192;
uint8_t* payloadbuffer = nullptr;
size_t payloadbufferSize = 0;
size_t payloadbufferIndex = 0;

void onOversizedMqttMessage(const espMqttClientTypes::MessageProperties& properties, const char* topic, const uint8_t* payload, size_t len, size_t index, size_t total) {
  // handle oversized messages
}

void onCompleteMqttMessage(const espMqttClientTypes::MessageProperties& properties, const char* topic, const uint8_t* payload, size_t len, size_t index, size_t total) {
  // handle assembled messages
}

void onMqttMessage(const espMqttClientTypes::MessageProperties& properties, const char* topic, const uint8_t* payload, size_t len, size_t index, size_t total) {
  // payload is bigger then max: return chunked
  if (total > maxPayloadSize) {
    onOversizedMqttMessage(properties, topic, payload, len, index, total);
    return;
  }

  // start new packet, increase buffer size if neccesary
  if (index == 0) {
    if (total > payloadbufferSize) {
      delete[] payloadbuffer;
      payloadbufferSize = total;
      payloadbuffer = new (std::nothrow) uint8_t[payloadbufferSize];
      if (!payloadbuffer) {
        // no buffer could be created. you might want to log this somewhere
        return;
      }
    }
    payloadbufferIndex = 0;
  }

  // add data and dispatch when done
  if (payloadBuffer) {
    memcpy(&payloadbuffer[payloadbufferIndex], payload, len);
    payloadbufferIndex += len;
    if (payloadbufferIndex == total) {
      // message is complete here
      onCompleteMqttMessage(properties, topic, payloadBuffer, total, 0, total);
      // optionally:
      delete[] payloadBuffer;
      payloadBuffer = nullptr;
      payloadbufferSize = 0;
    }
  }
}

// attach callback to MQTT client
mqttClient.onMessage(onMqttMessage);
```
